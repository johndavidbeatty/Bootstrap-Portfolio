      <p class="text-left">Hello, this is my Full Stack Development Bootcamp page. This is where I write a bunch of stuff telling you how wonderful I am so that you'll look and want to give me a job.  Except, I already have a job and am taking this class to learn coding more than change careers.</p>

      <p class="text-left">I'm in technical sales in the IT sector today.  I've spent the last 24 years mostly on the infrastructure side.  On the infrastructure side, I focused on how to design, deploy and sell the servers, storage and networking that runs enterprise data centers.</p>

      <p class="text-left">I'm taking this course to learn more about the software development side of the house.  On the infrastructure side, we would occasionally develop shell scripts but that is about it.  The industry is changing, and I thought it would be useful, as well as interesting, to learn coding.  Thanks for stopping by.</p>
